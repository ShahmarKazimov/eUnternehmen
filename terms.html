                            We are also not obligated to provide services if a postal service provider refuses delivery

                            documents
                            are not suitable for digitization, we are entitled to refuse digitization for that letter or

                            scope of services. We will then refuse acceptance.<br><br>4.5. We are not obligated to check
                            whether a letter contains particularly valuable items. We will handle valuable items with
                            the same care and security as your normal mail and are not obligated to store them in an

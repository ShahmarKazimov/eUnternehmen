                                multiple times. Cookie IDs can also be used to record so-called conversions, i.e.
                                whether a user sees an ad and later visits the advertiser's website and purchases
                                something there.<br><br>
                                Through remarketing, we can address users who have already interacted with our website.
                                Our ads are delivered when this target group visits a Google website or a website in the
                                Google advertising network. For this purpose, when our website is visited, Google
                                executes a code and so-called (re)marketing tags are integrated into the website. These
                                tags help store an individual cookie on the user's device. Cookies can be set by various
                                domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com or
                                googleadservices.com. This file records which websites users have visited, which content
                                they are interested in and which offers were used. In addition, technical information
                                about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other
                                information about the use of the online offer is stored. All user data is processed only
                                as pseudonymous data and does not contain any information with which we can personally
                                identify users. The ads displayed are therefore not targeted at a specific person, but
                                rather for the owner of the cookie.<br><br>
                                Further information on these processing activities, the technologies used, stored data
                                and the storage period can be found in the settings of our Consent Management Tool and

                                We use the Microsoft Advertising service (formerly Bing Ads) provided by Microsoft
                                Ireland Operations Limited (Microsoft Ireland/EU) on our website. Microsoft Advertising
                                is an online marketing service that uses the Universal Event Tracking (UET) tool to help
                                us target advertisements via the Microsoft Bing search engine. Microsoft Advertising
                                uses cookies for this purpose. Personal data in the form of online identifiers
                                (including cookie identifiers), IP addresses, device identifiers, and information about
                                device and browser settings is processed. Some of this data is information stored on the
                                device you use. In addition, other information is stored on the device you use via the
                                cookies used. Such storage of information by Microsoft Advertising or access to
                                information already stored on your device only takes place with your consent.<br><br>
                                Microsoft Advertising collects data via UET that allows us to track target audiences
                                using remarketing lists. When you visit our website, a cookie is stored on your device.
                                This allows Microsoft Advertising to recognize that you have visited our website and
                                display an ad when you subsequently use Microsoft Bing or Yahoo.<br><br>
                                The information is also used to compile conversion statistics, i.e., to record how many
                                users reached our website after clicking on an ad. This tells us the total number of
                                users who clicked on our ad and were redirected to our website. However, we do not
                                receive any information that could personally identify users.<br><br>
                                Cookies are set and your personal data is processed with your consent as described here.
                                The legal basis for data processing in connection with the Microsoft Advertising service
                                is therefore Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. A transfer of your data to the USA cannot be ruled
                                out. Please note the information in the "Data transfer to third countries" section.

                                We use the LinkedIn Insight Tag, a marketing product of LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited
                                Company (Ireland/EU), on our website. Information on LinkedIn Ireland's contact details
                                and the contact details of LinkedIn Ireland's data protection officer can be found in
                                LinkedIn's data policy at https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy.<br><br>
                                The LinkedIn Insight Tag is a JavaScript code snippet that is triggered by LinkedIn when
                                you visit our website and stores a cookie on your device. Such storage of information by
                                the LinkedIn Insight Tag or access to information already stored on your device, as well
                                as further processing of personal data in connection with the LinkedIn Insight Tag, only
                                occurs with your consent. The legal basis for the collection and transmission of
                                personal data by us to LinkedIn Ireland is therefore Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR.<br><br>
                                We can perform various functions using the LinkedIn Insight Tag, which we describe in
                                detail below. LinkedIn Conversion Tracking is an analytics feature supported by the
                                LinkedIn Insight Tag. The LinkedIn Insight Tag enables us to collect data about visits
                                to our website, including the URL, referrer URL, IP address, device and browser
                                properties (user agent), and timestamps. IP addresses are shortened or hashed (if used
                                to reach members across devices). LinkedIn does not provide us with any personal data;
                                it only provides reports (in which you are not identified) on the website audience and
                                ad performance. This allows us to measure the effectiveness of LinkedIn ads for
                                statistical and market research purposes.<br><br>
                                LinkedIn removes members' direct identifiers within seven days to pseudonymize the data.
                                LinkedIn then deletes the remaining pseudonymized data within 180 days.<br><br>
                                This processing is carried out for the purpose of obtaining information about our
                                website target audience and a report on the effectiveness of LinkedIn campaigns.
                                <br><br>We also use the Matched Audiences service to target our advertising campaigns to
                                specific audiences. LinkedIn Matched Audiences and related data integrations allow us to
                                target ads to specific audiences based on data we provide to LinkedIn (e.g., company
                                lists, hashed contact information, device identifiers, or event data such as websites
                                visited).<br><br>
                                This processing is carried out for the purpose of marketing our offers through the
                                targeted display of advertising.
                                We have entered into a joint controller agreement with LinkedIn, which defines the
                                allocation of data protection obligations between us and LinkedIn. We will be happy to
                                provide you with this document upon request.<br><br>
                                Please note that, in accordance with the LinkedIn Privacy Policy, LinkedIn also
                                processes personal data in the USA or other third countries. LinkedIn only transfers
                                personal data to countries for which the European Commission has issued an adequacy
                                decision pursuant to Art. 45 GDPR or on the basis of appropriate safeguards pursuant to
                                Art. 46 GDPR.

                                We use the Google Ads Conversions marketing service provided by Google Ireland Limited
                                (Ireland/EU). Google Ads enables us to place ads relevant to users in the Google
                                advertising network (e.g. in search results or on other websites), improve campaign
                                performance reports, and prevent a user from seeing ads multiple times. Each Ads
                                customer sets a different conversion cookie. These cookies cannot therefore be tracked
                                across the websites of different Ads customers. A cookie ID is used to record which ads
                                are displayed in which browser. This can prevent the same campaign from being displayed
                                multiple times. Cookie IDs can also be used to record so-called conversions, i.e.
                                whether a user sees an ad and later visits the advertiser's website and purchases
                                something there.<br><br>
                                Through remarketing, we can address users who have already interacted with our website.
                                Our ads are delivered when this target group visits a Google website or a website in the
                                Google advertising network. For this purpose, when our website is visited, Google
                                executes a code and so-called (re)marketing tags are integrated into the website. These
                                tags help store an individual cookie on the user's device. Cookies can be set by various
                                domains, including google.com, doubleclick.net, googlesyndication.com or
                                googleadservices.com. This file records which websites users have visited, which content
                                they are interested in and which offers were used. In addition, technical information
                                about the browser and operating system, referring websites, time of visit and other
                                information about the use of the online offer is stored. All user data is processed only
                                as pseudonymous data and does not contain any information with which we can personally
                                identify users. The ads displayed are therefore not targeted at a specific person, but
                                rather for the owner of the cookie.<br><br>
                                Further information on these processing activities, the technologies used, stored data
                                and the storage period can be found in the settings of our Consent Management Tool and
                                in Google's privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy.<br><br>
                                Google Marketing Services is used only with your consent in accordance with Art. 6 (1)
                                (a) GDPR. You can also permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by
                                deactivating personalized advertising in your Google Account:

                                For Google services, the transfer of data to Google Inc. in the USA and to countries
                                where Google Ireland or Google Ireland's subcontractors maintain facilities cannot be
